In artificial neural networks, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are designed for processing sequential data, such as text, speech, and time series, where the order of elements is important. Unlike feedforward neural networks, which process inputs independently, RNNs utilize recurrent connections, where the output of a neuron at one time step is fed back as input to the network at the next time step. This enables RNNs to capture temporal dependencies and patterns within sequences.eos
The fundamental building block of RNN is the recurrent unit, which maintains a hidden state—a form of memory that is updated at each time step based on the current input and the previous hidden state. This feedback mechanism allows the network to learn from past inputs and incorporate that knowledge into its current processing. RNNs have been successfully applied to tasks such as unsegmented, connected handwriting recognition, speech recognition, natural language processing, and neural machine translation.eos
However, traditional RNNs suffer from the vanishing gradient problem, which limits their ability to learn long-range dependencies. This issue was addressed by the development of the long short-term memory (LSTM) architecture in 1997, making it the standard RNN variant for handling long-term dependencies. Later, gated recurrent units (GRUs) were introduced as a more computationally efficient alternative.eos
In recent years, transformers, which rely on self-attention mechanisms instead of recurrence, have become the dominant architecture for many sequence-processing tasks, particularly in natural language processing, due to their superior handling of long-range dependencies and greater parallelizability. Nevertheless, RNNs remain relevant for applications where computational efficiency, real-time processing, or the inherent sequential nature of data is crucial.eos
